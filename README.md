# Keylogger

A keylogger, also known as a keystroke logger, is a type of spyware that secretly records every keystroke you make on your computer or other input devices, such as keyboards. It can capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages. Keyloggers can be either software-based (installed on your device) or hardware-based (physically connected to your system).
